This project was a very hard project specially the final milestone.
It was really hard to do it and I suffered a lot for it. For me, the milestone 1 
and final milestone was the most difficult of all. We had to make a program
for General Hospital.

This course has been amazing with professor Fardad. He is very hard working and 
teaches us well. He never hesitates to reach for help his students. I am very glad
I took his class.
